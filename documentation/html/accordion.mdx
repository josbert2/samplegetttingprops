# Tailwind CSS Accordion

Material Tailwind offers a robust accordion component built with Tailwind CSS that is perfect for situations where you need to integrate expand/collapse design.

The accordion is a UI component that allows the user to show and hide sections of related content on a page. There are many ways to use this component, like displaying a list of FAQs, showing various menus and submenus, displaying the locations of a particular company, and so on.

We created a series of accordion examples to help you build easier your application or website. All these examples are styled with Tailwind CSS and based on Material Design. Check them below.


<br />

## Accordion Examples:

## Accordion with Plus Minus Icon

This example features an expand - collapse icon that toggles between a plus sign to denote expansion and a minus sign for collapse. 

This visual cue is simple, providing users with a clear indication of how to interact with the accordion.

### Accordion Best Practices for Developers

• Indicate which sections are expanded or collapsed -  you can use icons like plus and minus.<br />
• For a smoother UX, use Tailwind CSS basic transitions and animations to animate the opening and closing of accordion sections.<br />
• Allow users to expand multiple sections simultaneously. If not, ensure that expanding one section collapses any previously expanded section.<br />
• Make sure that the sections don't contain too large amounts of content<br />
• Test your accordion to work consistently across different browsers and devices
